Quotes From Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Quote One:
Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
'Tis but a scratch.
A Scratch? YOUR ARM'S off.
NO IT ITSN'T.
What's that, then?
(LONG PAUSE) I've had worse.
You LIAR!
Come on ya pansy!

Quote Two:
I am your king.
Well, I didn't vote for you.
You don't vote for kings.
Well how'd you become king then?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by
divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT
is why I am your king.
Listen, strange women lyin' in ponds distributin' swirds is no
basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives
from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic
ceremony.

Quote Three:
[Sir Galahad the Chaste is being seduced by an entire castle
full of young women]
We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.
I don't think I was.
Yes, you were. You were in terrible peril.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.
No, it's too perilous.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.
No, we've got to find the Holy Grail. Come on.
Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?
No. It's unhealthy.
I bet you're gay.
Am not!

Quote Four:
[After Arthur's Cut off both of the black knight's arms]
Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left!
Yes I have.
Look!
It's just a flesh wound.

Quote Five:
Who's that then?
I dunno, must be a king.
Why?
He hasn't got shit all over him.
