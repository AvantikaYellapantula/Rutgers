Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,
and I'm not sure about the former.
Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great
scientist. They are wrong: it is character.
To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems
from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real
advance in science.
Scince is a way of life.
Science is a perspective.
Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding
in a manner that's precise, predictive, and reliable
a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it,
that is empowering and emotional.
